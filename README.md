Front-end projects built using bootstrap/flexbox

I built a few templates with the intent of understanding some new Bootstrap features I hadn't used before.

## Pattern
This was the first project I undertook in 2019. A simple gallery with a responsive design thanks to bootstrap.

1. margin utility classes
1. border utility classes
1. card component
1. new column breakpoints

## Museum of candy
This is another project designed to help me understand the bootstrap grid framework
